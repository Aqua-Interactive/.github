# Aqua Interactive 
Part of Aqua Development 2023

## Purpose
This Github organisation will be used for all sub-projects overseen and supported by Aqua Development. The primary function of this organisation is to streamline development and progress tracking amongst projects that are being supported or developed by Aqua Development or members of its Executive Team.  

## Our Teams
As part of this approach to streamlined project management, there will be two primary teams that are universal to all projects supported by Aqua Interactive.

- Building Team
- Programming Team

For each project we will have a team that is specifically assigned to handle the project.

### Building Team
The building team is a group of modellers, environment designers, and builders that have been specifically chosen to join the building team.

### Programming Team
The programming team is our group of experienced programmers, these people will be the main team for working on all aspects of coding for our projects.
